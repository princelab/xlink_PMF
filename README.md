=Description
xlink\_PMF is a search tool designed to search mzML files and a FASTA file to determine if there are any matches between the two at the precursor mass level.

To accomplish this, you should feed it a treated FASTA file which contains all of the possible crosslinks.  You can generate one of these from http://phenyx.proteomics.washington.edu/CXDB/index.cgi the xComb software.
